# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University!  Here's where all of my work will go for the semester.  

# About me
Hi! My name is Cooper, and I am in my final semester as at Master of Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College. I come from a Community Engagement background and had worked in the nonprofit space for 4 years prior to resuming my education. I am looking to move to DC once I graduate in December in the hopes of working in the public sector through policy analysis. 

# What I hope to learn
I am relatively new to data vizualization and joined the class because I want to learn how to make any data I collect through work or school more tangible and easy to follow. I am planning to work in a policy/program analyst role after I graduate, so this class will be incredibly helpful in terms of how to present raw data.:

Separate Pages:

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
