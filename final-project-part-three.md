# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Since the completion of part 2, I have made quite a few changes. Mainly, I added to and changed the entire format of my shorthand. I tried to include other visualizations that presented more of a call to action. I also changed the backgrounds and layouts of the shortand document to make it more palettable to readers. As far as data, I made use of more data that presented the debt share of different educational attainment levels, I presented a table I found about the return on investment that comes from receiving a college degree, and I made new visualizations in Tableau that highlighted the oversaturation of the degree market in recent years and used datawrapper to create a donut chart that showed what the debt share was. 

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

I discovered as I was going through every part of this final project, that my target audience was shifting. I believe it is still applicable for master's students as it can help them put into perspective the financial implications of gaining a degree, but I think it appeals more to those considering attending college. It was not meant to discourage people from going, but instead present the pros and cons, and show that there are other valuable options other than obtaining an advanced degree. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
> If you used AI to help you complete this assignment (within the parameters of the instruction and course guidelines), detail your use of AI for this assignment here.

I used AI to help me navigate shorthand as well as to assist me in trying to find new datasets, specifically with regard to finding information on student debt. 

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
