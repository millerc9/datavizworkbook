# User research 

I have been trying to find data that is US-centric, and also data that can go back about 40 years. I have been using the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census data primarliy. I have also found some useful data from the Federal Reserve, but am having a difficult time finding out how to best make use of it.

## Target audience
 I sought out mainly Heinz students to interview. I also interviewed another recent college grad that does is not pursing a graduate degree. I wanted to talk to Heinz students because the topic feels very applicable to them, and then I wanted one piece of outside perspective, so I decided to ask someone who is not pursing a graduate degree at this moment. Ultimately, I hope my audience would be my classmates, or those who are obtaining college degrees. I want this to raise interesting questions about the state of college education in the US, and show the pros and cons to gaining advanced degrees. 


## Interview script
Through these interviews I am hoping to get a sense of how impactful this presentation is. I also want to get an idea as to what I can do to improve the access here, as right now I feel the vizualizations can look a little confusing.  

Interview 1:

Question 1: What is your main takeaway from my presentation draft? Answer: It seems very straightforward, but the message is a little confusing, what am I supposed to get out of this?

Question 2: Are the visualizations clear? Answer: Yes, but they could use more labels, and the timelines are confusing, why would you start in 1993 for the line chart? 

Question 3:
Is there anything here that provides a call to action? Answer: Not really, it seems to be about a topic I can't really do much about. Maybe it is making me pay more attention to my student loan debt. 

Interview 2:

Question 1: What is your main takeaway from my presentation draft? Answer: I am having a tough time understanding what I am supposed to take away from this, it is a little all over the place. 

Question 2: Are the visualizations clear? Answer: Yes, you only have two fully fleshed out, I would add a couple more that present how income has kept up with inflation, or how debt has increased in recent years. 

Question 3:
Is there anything here that provides a call to action? Answer: It puts the perspective of gaining a degree in a monetary framework, so it does make me think more about gaining a positive ROI. But, it feels like there isn't much to do about it while I'm at school. 

Interview 3:

Question 1: What is your main takeaway from my presentation draft? Answer: It's pretty straightforward, but the design of the slides is a little clunky, and the background images are the templates that come with shorthand, so I would find a way to make the theme relate to your topic more. 

Question 2: Are the visualizations clear? Answer: Yes, but you should avoid using screenshots for this, I think. 

Question 3:
Is there anything here that provides a call to action? Answer: No, it feels out of my hands. 

## Interview findings

Findings:

Interview 1: The main thing I took away from this interview was that my presentation does not do a proper job of illustrating a main theme, it seems to just be randomly selected pieces of data. 

Interview 2: With this interview, it made me realize that the I could flesh out my idea a little more. I should probably add more visualizations, particularly ones that can contrast the positive correlation between unemployment and and income. How can I present this in more of a pros and cons way. 

Interview 3: 
My main takeaway here was that I haven't done a great job presenting my info, and my use of shorthand is not useful in its present stage. 

# Identified changes for Part III
For my final Part 3 stage, I have a good amount of work to do. First, I need to create a couple more data visualizations, mainly relating to debt amount from certain degrees. I also need to find a way to compare the ROI of gaining an advanced degree between the present day and moemnts in the past. I also should try to make it actionable in some way, but at this moment I am unsure of how to do that.  

I also am feeling a little overwhelmed by the data right now. I want to use history to express some sort of change to the benefits of a college education, but it is difficult to find useful data that describes what I want it to describe. Trying to focus on debt has been surprisingly difficult. I found some good statistics relating to national student debt, broken up by state, so I could use PA as an example since it is at the higher end, but I am hoping to still find national averages broken down by year if I can.

I have used Microsoft Copilot to help me find data sources to use for this project, since I have been having a difficult time getting data that applies directly to my project. I needed some help particularly relating to finding debt statistics by educational attainment. I also used it to help me in Tableau, mainly by helping me make my data fit in the data source section in a way that would make it more useable in the worksheet.
