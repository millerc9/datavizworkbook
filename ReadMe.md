# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University!  Here's where all of my work will go for the semester.  

# About me
Hi! My name is Cooper, and I am in my final semester as at Master of Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College. I come from a Community Engagement background and had worked in the nonprofit space for 4 years prior to resuming my education. I am looking to move to DC once I graduate in December in the hopes of working in the public sector through policy analysis. 

# What I hope to learn
I am relatively new to data vizualization and joined the class because I want to learn how to make any data I collect through work or school more tangible and easy to follow. I am planning to work in a policy/program analyst role after I graduate, so this class will be incredibly helpful in terms of how to present raw data.:

# Telling Stories with Data Final Project Part 1:

Outline

In this project, I am hoping to highight how employment trends have changed over the last few decades by education level. Particularly, I am interested in showing how employment rate has changed by amount of education people in the US have completed. For example, how has the employment rate looked over time for those with Masters degrees as opposed to those with only a high school education. I anticipate that the employment rate for those with Bachelor's and Master's degrees have declined over the last few decades due to oversaturation. With this, I am also going to research the attainment rates for degrees, and see how the country has transitioned over the years regarding what percentage of Americans are obtaining college degrees.

In addition to this data, I also want to show somee general economic data relating to degree level achieved. Specifically, I want to illustrate the differences in yearly income, distribution of occupation type, and amount of debt held between the different groups. I'm hoping to see what these changes look like from say 1980 through the present. With this, the picture I am hoping to paint is one that can illustrate the benefit of obtaining an advanced degree and what the pros and cons are associated with it. I am also considering showing the contrast in employment rate geographically, perhaps historical trends look very different when comparing different regions in the US. Ideally, I would like to show these trends historically while also providing a context for the current state of employment based on degree type.

Project Structure

I aim to structure this project in three parts. Overall, I am looking to show the audience the current state of US employment data by education type. First, I will provide visualizations that give a background on how the US population is broken down by education type. No degree, high school degree, associates, bachelors, masters, and PHD holders. I think this is much needed context before analyzing economic trends assoicated with these groups. Next, I will provide visualizations on the economic data relating these different education groups. I am specifically planning on showcasing the unemployment rate, median income, share of national student debt, etc... Lastly, I would like to visually show historical trends which showcase the value of either obtaining or not obtaining advanced degrees. Seeing the economic data of people by degree type historically should allow the viewer to see the present data in a better context.

Initial sketches

These sketches are not statistically accurate, they are simply estimates. I expect that these can illustrate how I will be able to create data visualizations to better explore the economic impact by degree level. I hope to use visualizations like this in order to provide demographic context as well.

The data

I am going to extensively use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I am choosing this source because their data is extensive, provides many different contexts and demographic data for employment statistics. I have also been able to find a great deal of data outside of the present context. I have not been able to search back as far as the 1960s, but I have found relevant data back towards the 1990s.

US Census data is also going to be very helpful as the timeline is normally further back than the Bureau of Labor statistics. There is also quite a bit more data to select from with the US Census. Between the two, I beleive I will have enough data to create meaningful visualizations, but there are pros and cons to both, so I plan to use them in tandem. With the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they provide bettwe rates of employment data, while the US Census Bureau more generally have attainment numbers, so I can better show actual population numbers. The 'Education Pays' tables in the BLS website show earnings by education level and employment type, so I see that as being a major souce for my visualizations.

Method and medium

For this project I am going to continue analyzing my data sources, particularly US Census data and the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. For my visualizations I will use handdrawn sketches as seen above to plan and find a direction for my final visualizations. As for my more polished and finished visualizations, I will be using Tableau Desktop. Lastly, I will use Shorthand for the final presentation in order to organize my visualizations into a storytelling format.

AI acknowledgements

I used ChatGPT to help me understand how to navigate the US Census data as it was a lot of information to choose from. I also asked if it had any ideas of where I should search for data given my topic of interest.

User research

I have been trying to find data that is US-centric, and also data that can go back about 40 years. I have been using the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census data primarliy. I have also found some useful data from the Federal Reserve, but am having a difficult time finding out how to best make use of it.

Target audience

I sought out mainly Heinz students to interview. I also interviewed another recent college grad that does is not pursing a graduate degree. I wanted to talk to Heinz students because the topic feels very applicable to them, and then I wanted one piece of outside perspective, so I decided to ask someone who is not pursing a graduate degree at this moment. Ultimately, I hope my audience would be my classmates, or those who are obtaining college degrees. I want this to raise interesting questions about the state of college education in the US, and show the pros and cons to gaining advanced degrees.

Interview script

Through these interviews I am hoping to get a sense of how impactful this presentation is. I also want to get an idea as to what I can do to improve the access here, as right now I feel the vizualizations can look a little confusing.

Interview 1:

Question 1: What is your main takeaway from my presentation draft? Answer: It seems very straightforward, but the message is a little confusing, what am I supposed to get out of this?

Question 2: Are the visualizations clear? Answer: Yes, but they could use more labels, and the timelines are confusing, why would you start in 1993 for the line chart?

Question 3: Is there anything here that provides a call to action? Answer: Not really, it seems to be about a topic I can't really do much about. Maybe it is making me pay more attention to my student loan debt.

Interview 2:

Question 1: What is your main takeaway from my presentation draft? Answer: I am having a tough time understanding what I am supposed to take away from this, it is a little all over the place.

Question 2: Are the visualizations clear? Answer: Yes, you only have two fully fleshed out, I would add a couple more that present how income has kept up with inflation, or how debt has increased in recent years.

Question 3: Is there anything here that provides a call to action? Answer: It puts the perspective of gaining a degree in a monetary framework, so it does make me think more about gaining a positive ROI. But, it feels like there isn't much to do about it while I'm at school.

Interview 3:

Question 1: What is your main takeaway from my presentation draft? Answer: It's pretty straightforward, but the design of the slides is a little clunky, and the background images are the templates that come with shorthand, so I would find a way to make the theme relate to your topic more.

Question 2: Are the visualizations clear? Answer: Yes, but you should avoid using screenshots for this, I think.

Question 3: Is there anything here that provides a call to action? Answer: No, it feels out of my hands.

Interview findings

Detail the findings from your interviews. Do not include PII. Capture specific insights where possible.
Findings:

Interview 1: The main thing I took away from this interview was that my presentation does not do a proper job of illustrating a main theme, it seems to just be randomly selected pieces of data.

Interview 2: With this interview, it made me realize that the I could flesh out my idea a little more. I should probably add more visualizations, particularly ones that can contrast the positive correlation between unemployment and and income. How can I present this in more of a pros and cons way.

Interview 3: My main takeaway here was that I haven't done a great job presenting my info, and my use of shorthand is not useful in its present stage.

Identified changes for Part III

For my final Part 3 stage, I have a good amount of work to do. First, I need to create a couple more data visualizations, mainly relating to debt amount from certain degrees. I also need to find a way to compare the ROI of gaining an advanced degree between the present day and moemnts in the past. I also should try to make it actionable in some way, but at this moment I am unsure of how to do that.

I also am feeling a little overwhelmed by the data right now. I want to use history to express some sort of change to the benefits of a college education, but it is difficult to find useful data that describes what I want it to describe. Trying to focus on debt has been surprisingly difficult. I found some good statistics relating to national student debt, broken up by state, so I could use PA as an example since it is at the higher end, but I am hoping to still find national averages broken down by year if I can.

AI acknowledgements

I have used Microsoft Copilot to help me find data sources to use for this project, since I have been having a difficult time getting data that applies directly to my project. I needed some help particularly relating to finding debt statistics by educational attainment. I also used it to help me in Tableau, mainly by helping me make my data fit in the data source section in a way that would make it more useable in the worksheet.
