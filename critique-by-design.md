Critique By Design Assignment: Wimbledon Championship Statistics 

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique
The image provided in step 1 is a vizualization showing where Wimbledon winners are from. Here we see how many men have won the championship from each country. Ultimately, this image is useful for one specific audience, tennis fans. As far as completeness, the vizualization features the whole glboe, through the use of bubbles of varying sizes, we see the number of winners. For example, the US has the most with 6 winners, so it has the largest bubble. This makes the vizualization feel interactive and fun. The fact that we can see the winners through a global view makes it easier to read and can help the viewer distinguish where winners are in which continent. However, we get into some issues when we look at Europe. With winners from smaller countries like Croatia and Serbia, these bubbles become difficult to distinguish. Also, with countries spaced close together, it is difficult to easily tell which country you are viewing. Because of these issues, I am looking to move away from the use of bubbles and focus on one specific area. Because of this, I am hoping to focus only on Europe, because that is where teh majority of winners are from, and limiting the scope will make it easier to distingish the countries. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask: 

- Can you tell what this vizualization is about at first glance?

- What confuses you the most?

- Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans?

Results: 

Interview 1:

Question 1: Can you tell what this is about at first glance? Answer: Yes, but the title makes it a little confusing        
Question 2: What confuses you the most? Answer: If this is supposed to be about the number of winners, or the amount of championships won by each player.
Question 3: Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans? Answer: I think so, but only if they follow sports in general.

Interview 2: 

Question 1: Can you tell what this is about at first glance? Answer: Yes, it seems pretty straightforward.         
Question 2: What confuses you the most? Answer: The color scheme is a little odd. I have a difficult time noticing the differences between the colors for the countries. 
Question 3: Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans? Answer: It's interesting, but I don't know if I would care if I didn't watch tennis. 

Interview 3:

Question 1: Can you tell what this is about at first glance? Answer: Not from the image itself, only after I saw teh title.         
Question 2: What confuses you the most? Answer: I am not sure what the colors mean, it is difficult to tell which countries have the most championships. it also would be helpful to see the names of the champions. 
Question 3: Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans? Answer: Yes, but I see it as being made almost exclusively for that demographic. 

Synthesis: 

The most common feedback I received was relating to the color scheme. Simply using different shades of green made it difficult to tell the difference in championship counts between countries. I was also told there could be more annotation between the countries. From the feedback I learned I had to change my color pallete to make the countries more distinguishable. I also realized I had to provide more descriptive information on the counties, particularly thorugh annotating outside of simply using color. For my final redesign, I plan to change the color scheme, and use other colors apart from green. I also want to change the title, it is a little wordy at the moment and not straightforward enough. Lastly, I am hoping to place the actual count of championship winners within the country in addition to using color. 

## Step five: build the solution

Here is my final solution to the critique by design assignment. Here, I used the data associated with the flourish webpage, that had 8 Wimbledon charts. I used this data to develop a count of the Wimbledon Singles Championships earned by country. In comparison to the initial chart I critiqued, I narrowed the scope a great deal, and decided to include only Europe. I did this because the global view made distinguishing European countries quite difficult. Because most winners were from Europe, I thought it would be interesting to just focus on European winners. I only focused on the count here becuase I wanted the chart to be simple and straightforward. There was a lot of data; names of winners, year they won, and the amount of championships per winner. Focusing on only on the count by country made the map easier to read. I also changed the color format from only green, to a gold/green diverging pallete. The differences in green shades was slight and made it difficult to notice differences between countries, and I did not want to use any red because that would connotate poor performance. Using two primary colors made it easier to see the difference between a country winning 2 championships versus 8 for example. Lastly, I included annotations above the countries to show the count in addition to the country abbreviation. I wanted the main objectives of the chart to be noticeable without having to use interactive map features.

As far as the process overall is concerned, I enjoy that I was able to sit with the visualization for over a week. I was able to focus on the same data source the whole time and tinker with my own solutions regularly. The peer reviewed feedback in class was also very helpful, as my classmates were able to show me areas I hadn't seen where the vizualization was unclear. This helped me tremendously when I was doin gmy final redesign and allowed me to focus on readability of my charts.

I used Microsoft Copilot to help me learn how to put images within this page. I also used it to assist me with navigating Tableau, particularly how to label correctly.
