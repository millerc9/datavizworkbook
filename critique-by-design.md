# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique
The image provided in step 1 is a vizualization showing where Wimbledon winners are from. Here we see how many men have won the championship from each country. Ultimately, this image is useful for one specific audience, tennis fans. As far as completeness, the vizualization features the whole glboe, through the use of bubbles of varying sizes, we see the number of winners. For example, the US has the most with 6 winners, so it has the largest bubble. This makes the vizualization feel interactive and fun. The fact that we can see the winners through a global view makes it easier to read and can help the viewer distinguish where winners are in which continent. However, we get into some issues when we look at Europe. With winners from smaller countries like Croatia and Serbia, these bubbles become difficult to distinguish. Also, with countries spaced close together, it is difficult to easily tell which country you are viewing. Because of these issues, I am looking to move away from the use of bubbles and focus on one specific area. Because of this, I am hoping to focus only on Europe, because that is where teh majority of winners are from, and limiting the scope will make it easier to distingish the countries. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask: 

- Can you tell what this vizualization is about at first glance?

- What confuses you the most?

- Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans?


Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


Interview 1:

Question 1: Can you tell what this is about at first glance? Answer: Yes, but the title makes it a little confusing        
Question 2: What confuses you the most? Answer: If this is supposed to be about the number of winners, or the amount of championships won by each player.
Question 3: Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans? Answer: I think so, but only if they follow sports in general.

Interview 2: 

Question 1: Can you tell what this is about at first glance? Answer: Yes, it seems pretty straightforward.         
Question 2: What confuses you the most? Answer: The color scheme is a little odd. I have a difficult time noticing the differences between the colors for the countries. 
Question 3: Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans? Answer: It's interesting, but I don't know if I would care if I didn't watch tennis. 

Interview 3:

Question 1: Can you tell what this is about at first glance? Answer: Not from the image itself, only after I saw teh title.         
Question 2: What confuses you the most? Answer: I am not sure what the colors mean, it is difficult to tell which countries have the most championships. it also would be helpful to see the names of the champions. 
Question 3: Do you think this would interest non-tennis fans? Answer: Yes, but I see it as being made almost exclusively for that demographic. 

Synthesis: 

The most common feedback I received was relating to the color scheme. Simply using different shades of green made it difficult to tell the difference in championship counts between countries. I was also told there could be more annotation between the countries. From the feedback I learned I had to change my color pallete to make the countries more distinguishable. I also realized I had to provide more descriptive information on the counties, particularly thorugh annotating outside of simply using color. For my final redesign, I plan to change the color scheme, and use other colors apart from green. I also want to change the title, it is a little wordy at the moment and not straightforward enough. Lastly, I am hoping to place the actual count of championship winners within the country in addition to using color. 
## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
