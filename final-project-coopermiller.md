# Final Project Part 1: 

# Outline 
 
In this project, I am hoping to highight how employment trends have changed over the last few decades by education level. Particularly, I am interested in showing how employment rate has changed by amount of education people in the US have completed. For example, how has the employment rate looked over time for those with Masters degrees as opposed to those with only a high school education. I anticipate that the employment rate for those with Bachelor's and Master's degrees have declined over the last few decades due to oversaturation. With this, I am also going to research the attainment rates for degrees, and see how the country has transitioned over the years regarding what percentage of Americans are obtaining college degrees. 

In addition to this data, I also want to show somee general economic data relating to degree level achieved. Specifically, I want to illustrate the differences in yearly income, distribution of occupation type, and amount of debt held between the different groups. I'm hoping to see what these changes look like from say 1980 through the present. With this, the picture I am hoping to paint is one that can illustrate the benefit of obtaining an advanced degree and what the pros and cons are associated with it. I am also considering showing the contrast in employment rate geographically, perhaps historical trends look very different when comparing different regions in the US. Ideally, I would like to show these trends historically while also providing a context for the current state of employment based on degree type. 

# Project Structure

I aim to structure this project in three parts. Overall, I am looking to show the audience the current state of US employment data by education type. First, I will provide visualizations that give a background on how the US population is broken down by education type. No degree, high school degree, associates, bachelors, masters, and PHD holders. I think this is much needed context before analyzing economic trends assoicated with these groups. Next, I will provide visualizations on the economic data relating these different education groups. I am specifically planning on showcasing the unemployment rate, median income, share of national student debt, etc... Lastly, I would like to visually show historical trends which showcase the value of either obtaining or not obtaining advanced degrees. Seeing the economic data of people by degree type historically should allow the viewer to see the present data in a better context. 

## Initial sketches
These sketches are not statistically accurate, they are simply estimates. I expect that these can illustrate how I will be able to create data visualizations to better explore the economic impact by degree level. I hope to use visualizations like this in order to provide demographic context as well.

# The data

I am going to extensively use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I am choosing this source because their data is extensive, provides many different contexts and demographic data for employment statistics. I have also been able to find a great deal of data outside of the present context. I have not been able to search back as far as the 1960s, but I have found relevant data back towards the 1990s. 

US Census data is also going to be very helpful as the timeline is normally further back than the Bureau of Labor statistics. There is also quite a bit more data to select from with the US Census. Between the two, I beleive I will have enough data to create meaningful visualizations, but there are pros and cons to both, so I plan to use them in tandem. With the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they provide bettwe rates of employment data, while the US Census Bureau more generally have attainment numbers, so I can better show actual population numbers. The 'Education Pays' tables in the BLS website show earnings by education level and employment type, so I see that as being a major souce for my visualizations.

# Method and medium
  For this project I am going to continue analyzing my data sources, particularly US Census data and the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. For my visualizations I will use handdrawn sketches as seen above to plan and find a direction for my final visualizations. As for my more polished and finished visualizations, I will be using Tableau Desktop. Lastly, I will use Shorthand for the final presentation in order to organize my visualizations into a storytelling format. 

## AI acknowledgements
I used ChatGPT to help me understand how to navigate the US Census data as it was a lot of information to choose from. I also asked if it had any ideas of where I should search for data given my topic of interest.
